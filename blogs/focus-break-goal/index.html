            After a long time, here I am writing again about something that most of the learners struggles with: how to
            stay focused.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Focus isn’t about consuming less time on screen. True focus is the ability to concentrate your mental energy
            on one task while ignoring distractions. Not focusing on one thing is a natural aspect of human behaviour.
            For example, you decided to start learning a programming language and selected a YouTube tutorial to begin
            with. However, on screen, you find some recommendations of other things that divert your attention away from
            the topic, or when you sit to study your phone notification may distract you. You may notice that people who
            have reading habits are more focused in the presence of silence. Noice can be distractive for these types of
            people. This is a common human behaviour that happens with most learners.
        </p>

            As you seen, the above article says that, your concentration level may vary due to the amount of energy
            required to complete the task and how fully motivated you are to complete the task. Some may fully engage in
            their task, while others might not. Then to improve focus, make a focus point on your workspace, it might be
            a circle or dot or any other object and start observing it and see that how many minutes you could focus on
            that object and how much you have distracted, after sometime you may not need it. Solving cube may help you
            and I have heard that, learning with the group of interested people can help a lot, but until now, I haven't
            experienced the group learning and I think I have missed it as I haven't found anyone till now or they might
            not be interested.

            The next is break, a break is not about free time where you start scrolling or walking around. Here you
            should evaluate yourself for 1-2min, where your thought comes up. You have focused and consumed the content
            on a topic, but if you can’t explain it to yourself or your friend, then you have only go on watching the
            tutorials, but not absorbed the things. Your brain need time to understand and absorb the things. Just go on
            watching tutorial is waste of time, nothing else.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            The next is goal. If you don’t have goal, then you don’t need the first two. Without goal you can’t even
            start learning the things. I have seen people once they start learning something and keep on switching to
            other stacks by listening to some reel makers, but they do nothing, keep on demotivating you. So, define
            your goal before starting something, and stick on to that goal until you reach the goal and while defining
            goal be clear that what you want to learn and why you want to learn that and think that are you ready to
            invest time on it. Once your goal is clear, focus and consistency will align to it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Focused and Scared, the difference between these two people is trust on themselves. Both the focused and the
            scared one knows that how the things are learnt, they know the roadmap, resources and how to practice it,
            but scared one does not have the self-belief or confidence in them to complete the task. They doubt on
            themselves, which kills their ability or potential in them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Sharing the things that you have worked on help you and others a lot. When you share things, you not only
            share your thoughts, but it might help someone who feel less alone in their challenges. Your experience
            might encourage someone going through similar things. Even you might get the opportunity to work with the
            experienced one. Someone may recognise your work, which helps in boosting your confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            At the end I could improve yourself day by day. Learn something new, its okay if the progress feels slow.
            What matters is that you doing the things and moving, even a little. Because each you are becoming better
            version of yourself.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Lot of things are there to learn. Its time to focus on my exams. If you found this post helpful, share it
            with your friends or someone who might need it.

        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Stay focused.
