        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            This is the first time I've written about my interests. I thought of writing this many days ago.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            My interest in designing web pages started with an internship task given by my college. While searching for
            a way to complete the task, I found an internship related to frontend development online and got into it.
            However, I completed it at an earlier stage using tools like AI.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            In between, I was interested, how these things are made. So, I started learning the core of web development.
            While learning, I was so excited that I had finished HTML and the basics of CSS within two weeks. I was able
            to build a basic web page and I built a webpage about myself (<a href="https://sathwik344.netlify.app/"
                class="underline" target="_blank">My first Page</a>), which help me a lot in boosting my confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            I started exploring more and I built a website for my friend to display all his artworks. Once I realized
            that I spent lot of time in CSS, I started learning JS which was easier to learn at earlier stage, because I
            was familiar with programming languages like C and Java, which I was studied in 1st year of my college, but
            going deeper into it, I realized that it was not as easy as I had thought it would be.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            I asked my seniors about their sources for learning and gathered some insights, and started following it.
            Till today, I have good knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, and I have learnt a CSS framework - Tailwind CSS, which
            is a wonderful framework where you use the utility class for style. I know it may be hard to listen to all
            these words if you know nothing about web development. I was also the same person you are now at the
            beginning stage.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Though I have knowledge about these things, I don’t know everything that is there. Sometimes I Google things
            or refer to the documentations, and one thing to keep in mind for all beginners that, learn things while
            practicing on the keyboard and don’t waste more time on watching tutorials on YouTube. Explore the things by
            yourself, which may help you remember the things faster and boost your confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            This is for beginners who are new, don’t waste more time on CSS, it’s like a rabbit hole, if you try to
            master it, you will be learning CSS for more than a year, so don’t waste time, you will eventually learn it
            while making sites. JS is must learn thing if you want to go deeper in web development based on JavaScript,
            or else you can also implement backend by Python or Java, but for frontend learning JavaScript is a must.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Be consistent and work daily, and there might be some people around you who may, sorry… who will say lot of
            things, like “AI will make your work in seconds, you are wasting your time” and many more, but don’t get
            distracted to those fears ,and you will be implementing AI later, it’s better to avoid relying too much on
            AI as of now, because it can affect your productivity ,once you are ok or you can debug the things by your
            own you can implement it, and avoid doom scrolling on you mobile phones – it wastes time and energy and always remember that <code>100 skills &times; 0 visibility = 0 opportunities</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            And don’t forget that you have to study for your college internals and semester exams. You would have been
            afraid that I could manage both? You will. Always finish the college things and get in to your other stuffs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Reminder: web development is not the only thing, there are lot of things to learn. This is all I know, I
            have written how much I know. I am still learning the things and already said that I doesn’t know
            everything. This is the first time am writing, if there is any grammatical mistake, please ignore it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Thank You for reading.
