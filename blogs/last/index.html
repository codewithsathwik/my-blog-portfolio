        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            From talking to everyone to not even thinking about it—being no one's priority, no interaction, liked by
            none, drowned in loneliness. It’s been very hard to be like this. Being like this has cost me many
            opportunities in my life. Mentioning my mother for the first time: how she has sacrificed everything for me
            and my brother. </p>

        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Apart from this, the last few months are my most precious months, because of my hard work. Being good at
            studies, good at my interested things. So many people have tried to harm me, but it helped me to work more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Some people might think that I am egoistic, but let me tell you—it's not ego, it's survival. I've learned to
            protect my energy, to focus on what builds me up. Those "harms" you threw my way? They were fuel. They
            pushed me to work harder, day after day, building strength I didn't know I had.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Now, if I want to express myself, I can’t. The past incidents stop me from saying something real or trusting
            someone deeply. Every word feels like a risk, every hand extended a potential trap. I've been burned too
            many times, left alone. And I've realized one thing: no one is coming to save you in your hardest times.
        </p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            At the end of the day, it's a son fulfilling the dreams of his mother, who sacrificed her entire life for
            me.</p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            And I want to mention one thing: some people may win with their "politics," but when it comes to my own
            "ability," I definitely win.</p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Trying to do something big in the coming days—you don’t even expect it.</p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            These days, I've lost interest in almost everything. But one _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. It reminds me: _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _</p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            This isn't end—it's a reset. Stepping away to heal, build, live my way.</p>
        <p class="text-xs font-medium text-gray-800 md:text-sm ">
            Ending with my idol’s words – “Life has thrown a lot of lemons at me, but I have made lemonade out of it.
